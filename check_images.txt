Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, the three model architectures didn't classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed.
        AlexNet Dog_01 classifier: Pembroke, Pembroke Welsh corgi, corgi
        VGG Dog_01 classifier: Pembroke, Pembroke Welsh corgi, corgi
        ResNet Dog_01 classifier: chow, chow chow

        The real breed of Dog_01 is : Akita


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, each of the three model architectures didn't classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg.

        AlexNet:    Dog_01.jpg: Pembroke, Pembroke Welsh corgi, corgi
                    Dog_02.jpg: lesser panda, red panda, panda, bear cat, cat bear, Ailurus fulgens

        VGG:        Dog_01.jpg: Pembroke, Pembroke Welsh corgi, corgi
                    Dog_02.jpg: gibbon, Hylobates lar

        ResNet:     Dog_01.jpg: chow, chow chow
                    Dog_02.jpg: gibbon, Hylobates lar


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures correctly classified Cat_01.jpg and Coffee_mug_01.jpg to not be dogs.

        AlexNet:    Cat_01.jpg: Classified as Persian cat, cat (correctly identified as not a dog)
                    Coffee_mug_01.jpg: Classified as cup (correctly identified as not a dog)


        VGG:        Cat_01.jpg: Classified as Egyptian cat, cat (correctly identified as not a dog)
                    Coffee_mug_01.jpg: Classified as cup (correctly identified as not a dog)


        ResNet:     Cat_01.jpg: Classified as tabby, tabby cat, cat (correctly identified as not a dog)
                    Coffee_mug_01.jpg: Classified as coffee mug (correctly identified as not a dog)




4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I think ResNet did the best job overall.

        Non-Dog Images:     All three models correctly identified the cat and the coffee mug as not dogs. 
                            However, ResNet gave the most detailed and accurate labels: "tabby cat" for the
                            cat and "coffee mug" for the mug.

        Dog vs. Not-Dog:    ResNet correctly identified all images that were not dogs, just like the other models.
                            But again, it was more specific with its labels for the non-dog images.

        Dog Breed:          While none of the models got the dog breeds right, ResNet correctly identified Dog_01.jpg 
                            as a dog and got one match for Dog_02.jpg.

        So, even though all models struggled with the exact dog breeds, ResNet was the best at giving detailed 
        and accurate labels, especially for the non-dog images.
